# Geospatial-Data-Science
Projects/coursework related to a geospatial data science course taken at UC San Diego in collaboration with @esanchez01.

These notebooks are rather large.  As always, [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) may be the preferred way to view the notebooks.  To do this, copy the link to the `.ipynb` file instead of opening it, and paste that url in the NBViewer website.  Just be warned that a minute or so should be allocated for the notebook to load fully!

Parts of the notebooks have been obfuscated to prevent coding plagiarism in future iterations of the course.  Contact me for more details.
