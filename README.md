# Geospatial-Data-Science
Projects/coursework related to a geospatial data science course taken at UC San Diego in collaboration with @esanchez01.

As always, [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) may be the preferred way to view the notebooks.  To do this, copy the link to the `.ipynb` file instead of opening it, and paste that url in the NBViewer website.  Just be warned that a minute or so should be allocated for the notebook to load fully!

Parts of the notebooks have been rewritten, deleted, or otherwise modified in effort to prevent coding plagiarism in future iterations of the course.  Contact me for more details.

**If you are a student in a future iteration of this course,** please do not continue looking at this repository—for your sake.  The professor is very familiar with these submissions and *will* recognize if code and/or analysis has been unceremoniously borrowed from this repository.  If you are struggling with the course please contact me—or better yet, contact the professor/TAs—directly to ask for assistance!  We are here for you.  This was a challenging course, and I had to prevent myself from giving up half way through the quarter due to time consumption, so I understand where you're coming from.  Don't give up hope, maintain your integrity, and we'll be here to help you.
